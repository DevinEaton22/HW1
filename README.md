Some considerations I made when when designing this program were to use strings to store my data. The data could have also been stored in a list, but a string was the best choice for this project as it can easily be spliced and appended to. Another consideration was primarily using for loops and if statements. While a similar result could be achieved using while loops, for loops were easier to write and follow for this project. The code works properly for the three sets of inputs tested, and it would still work properly with the majority of other inputs for reference lenth, number of reads and read length. The only exeptions would be references that are too small. This would mess up the reads and alignments later on as there isn't enough data to work with.


While the distributions will be close to the designated 15%, 75% and 10% for the zero, one and two alignments, they may not be exact. This can be due to the fact that the random  string created by the zero alignment may actually match to a portion of the reference string. 


I spent about 8 hours total on this project and about 3-4 hours on this section. I had to rewrite sections of the program several times, but I felt that I got a better understanding of the assignment as I progressed. I feel much more confortable with string operations and have a better understanding of file reads and writes.
